The official telsoc IRC server!

This is an official chat server for telsoc enthusiasts programmed in C

Users can connect to it with an IRC client and be able to talk to other people active in the server

We have written our own IRC protocol that runs on this project. 

It is one of the early projects developed by 3 out of the 4 of the founding committee of telsoc

This is a project created by
Aria barnes-collett
Aidan Hammond
Cam A.

If you have any issues with this, feel free to ping admin on the telsoc discord server!
